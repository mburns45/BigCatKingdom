      <p>The Rocky Mountain's are home of some of the most resilent animals in the world. From the sudden changes in elavation to the beyond freezing temperatures. The trechorous landscape is a rough terrian that if not careful can be lethal. With how dangerous the rockies can be it seems it would be impossible for anything to thrive there, but with evolution nature finds a way. From a pine tree to a big cat both have evolved to allow them to not only survive these conditions but to flourish. This is the reason big cats in North America typically live in the mountains because they are adapted to this enviornment.</p>

      <h3><b>History of North America's Rocky Mountains</b></h3>
      <h5>How have humans changed the mountains over time?</h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Humans have been present in the Rocky Mountains from bewtween 8,000 and 10,000 BCE. More specifically native americans. Native americans are people who take pride with being connected to nature and never using more than they would need from nature. This changed once the french had come through the rockies in 1739. Fur trappers main goal was to get has many pelts as they could to sell for riches. This affected many populations of animals in the rockies another issue humans have created is pollution. From pollution soil and water are affected leading to changes in enviornment that can cause many species to go extinct. Luckilly this is something we are aware of and are currently trying to prevent and repair the land as best we can given the circumstances.</p>
