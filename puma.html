    <p> If you've been to the North American continent you may be thinking this is a mountain lion, and if you thought that you'd be right! A mountain lion and a puma are the same cat the main difference between a puma in North America and a puma in South America is the size. The closer you get to the equator the smaller a puma is. In South America the puma is smaller and this works in it's favor by requiring less energy and also can hold less fat because of the climate. The length of a amazon puma is 11 feet with a lot of that length coming from there long tail. The puma comes in at 200 lbs and primarily feeds on various species of deer. Currently in South America there are around 200,000 and 300,000 but like the other species of animals in the amazon it is difficult to have an accurate number.
