    <p>The king of big cats is widely known as the lion. The african lion will travel in a pride of lions anywhere from two to forty lions. This is split up between 3-4 male lions, about a dozen of female lions, and there young. Competition is the name of the game, for male lions they typically leave the pride to create there own pride after a few years of maturing. Females will typically live with a lion pride the rest of there lives. Dominant male lions run the pride by protecting it and leading them to new lands. The females are responsible for the young and food within the pride. A fully grown african lion can get up to 9 feet long and weigh up to 420 lbs. Currently there are approximately 20,000 to 30,000 african lions alive in the wild today.
