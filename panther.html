    <p>The panther or jaguar can be found not only in Africa but in South America. Even though a black panther doesnt look the same as a leopard they are the same species. When a jaguar appears black that is a rare color variation. The jaguar is able to reach lengths of up to nine feet and weigh in at 350 pounds. They are the largest spotted cat in South America and mainly prey on capybaras, deer, tortoises, and even monkeys. Being excellent tree climbers is such a main component of there lifestyle living in the rain forest. Currently in South America there are around 50,000 to 150,000 jaguars with populations being difficult to gather based on there location.
